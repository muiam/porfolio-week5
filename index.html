          My name is Harrison Mwendwa Muia. I am a self taught software
          developer who has undergone intense training via popwer learn project

          college at makueni county for a certification in computer application
          just before joining the university of Nairobi for my bachelor of
          education (ICT) degree. Since then i have been coding and doing
          projects to learn more about coding as i solve real life situations

        <p>I have done the following works since i started coding</p>

        <h1>Jubilee college portal</h1>
        <div class="details-flex">
          <details>
            This web portal is a student centered application that enables
            students, school administration and the tutors centralize their
            communication activities in the school. The portal also allows for
            students to enroll for admission as well as track their course
            applications

        <h1>Chriana Facilities management (CFM)</h1>
        <div class="details-flex">
          <details>
            CFM is a multi-service provider company located in Ruaka , Nairobi
            kenya. I developed the company website as well as their quotations
            software. The quoatations software enables the company send
            quoatations to their clients seemlessly and hence reduce too much
            paper work in the operations of the company. I also provide support
            in their email communications
